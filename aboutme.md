Hello! My name is Rico Jia and I am currently a robotics software engineer working on robotics web backend development and navigation. I am a firm believer of the idea that "there's no better learning than doing". So, I enjoy understanding interesting ideas, and implementing them from scratch. I also believe in the power of "first principle" - to build & manage a system well, always understand the lowest-level fundamentals well. So, in this nerd cluster, there are many articles about fundamentals.

Hello! My name is Rico Jia and I am currently a robotics software engineer working on robotics backend development, navigation, and machine learning. I am a firm believer of the idea that "there's no better learning than doing". So, I enjoy understanding interesting ideas, and **implementing them from scratch**. I also believe in the power of "first principle" - to build & manage a system well, always understand the lowest-level fundamentals well. This universe is evolving with basic elements, after all. So, in this nerd cluster, there are many articles about fundamentals.

In the [Open Learning Section](https://ricojia.github.io/openlearning), I have a list of self-directed courses and projects that I implemented from scratch. The bulk of the blog articles here are actually "by-products" of those projects ðŸ˜›.

On the side, I'm a committed amateur soccer player. I've been playing at intermediate/advanced leagues as a striker, midfielder, and even defender (depends on what the team needs, of course). For soccer, the "first principle" still holds - good players work on the basic movements day in and day out. Besides that, soccer is really "hands-on" (or "foot-on") - one can see the results and get an instantaneous adrenalene rush, even from the most basic passes, dribbles, etc.

Hello! My name is Rico Jia, and I am a robotics software engineer focusing on backend development, navigation, and machine learning. I firmly believe in the idea that **"there's no better learning than doing"**. I enjoy understanding interesting ideas and **implementing them from scratch**. Additionally, I hold to the principle of "first principles"â€”to build and manage a system well, **one must understand the lowest-level fundamentals thoroughly**. After all, this universe is built from basic elements. So in my articles, I often try to delve into these fundamentals.

I also believe in the power of "compound interest" in knowledge and experience. If someone **understands and remembers a tiny bit of useful information every day**, their tech stack will grow exponentially over time. There are no shortcuts to this process. Writing helps me organize my thoughts, so I document interesting facts and knowledge points. However, I don't trust my long-term memoryâ€”a concept learned months ago could fade. Therefore, I aim to organize my articles in a simple, straightforward, and no-nonsense manner.

In the [Open Learning Section](https://ricojia.github.io/openlearning), I have a list of self-directed courses and projects that I implemented from scratch. The bulk of the blog articles here are actually "by-products" of those projects ðŸ˜›.

On the side, I'm a committed amateur soccer player. I've been playing at intermediate/advanced leagues as a striker, midfielder, and even defender (depending on what the team needs, of course). For soccer, the "first principle" philosophy still holds - good players work on the basic movements day in and day out. Besides that, soccer is really "hands-on" (or "foot-on") - one can see the results and get an instantaneous adrenalene rush, even from the most basic passes, dribbles, etc.

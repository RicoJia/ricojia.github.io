Hello! I'm Rico Jia, a robotics engineer with a knack for robotics navigation and deep neural networks. I love bringing interesting ideas to life from scratch. I earned my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at the University of British Columbia before going on to get my masters in robotics at Northwestern University under [Prof. Matthew Elwin](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/people/profiles/faculty/elwin-matt.html). As a native to Beijing, China, I love sharing what I've seen in both Mandarin and English. 

I currently  work as a robotics software engineer with a focus on robotics software infrastructure development, navigation, and machine learning. Previously, I was a software engineer at Northwestern University's Shirley Ryan AbilityLab and Accel Robotics, and I also served as a project lead at Diligent Robotics.

I live in Houston, Texas. In my spare time, I am the captain and forward of a local soccer teamand enjoy learning Turkish and Spanish. My virtual presence can be found on [Github](https://github.com/RicoJia).

## No Global Variables

To evaluate our code samples, Leetcode simply import the file containing our implementation. Then, it will run test cases on it. If we have a global variable, the global variable will be used consistently. E.g., 

```cpp
int MyGlobalVar2;    // bad

class Solution{
    int MyGlobalVar;    // good
};
```

## Shortcuts & Debugging Tips

- `ctrl - '` is to run.
- Leetcode does support `std::cout` in a separate window `stdout`.

## Questions

### Two Pointers

[Question Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=two-pointers)

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p align="center">
       <figure>
            <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dedd4d95-5bc9-423f-a674-50d451950c41" height="400" alt=""/>

</div>

Two pointers is a local gradient descent technique: we use 2 points starting from the head and tail of the vector. Calculate the area, then move the pointer if its side is shorter than the other. 

```cpp
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int i_s = 0, i_e = height.size()-1;
        int max = 0;
        while (i_s != i_e){
            int area = std::min(height.at(i_s), height.at(i_e)) * (i_e - i_s); 
            max = std::max(area, max);
            if (height.at(i_s) > height.at(i_e)){
                i_e --;
            }
            else{
                i_s ++;
            }
        }
        // Why does this work? gradient descent? 
        return 0;
    }
```

In this case, it can **actually guarantee** to find the global maximum. Why? Because as we move the pointers along, we are actually evaluating:
1. what's the max when size = L
1. what's the max when size = L-1 (apparently if we move the pointer the way we do)
1. What's the max when size = L-2 (still, we can find the max there)

So we find all these local maximums, which covers all combination of sides. So, two pointers is an interesting algorithm!

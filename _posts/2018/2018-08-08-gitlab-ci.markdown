# ðŸ§ª Basic Pipeline

1. Build Strategy Options: there are two main ways to build Docker images in GitLab CI:
    - Option A: Docker-in-Docker (DinD)
        - Requires privileged: true.
        - Enables full Docker commands inside a container.
        - More self-contained but slower and more complex.
    - Option B: Test in default container and split Jobs
        - login_job â€“ performs Docker login.
        - build_job â€“ builds and tags the image.
        - push_job â€“ pushes to registry.
            - Use cache: to persist login credentials between jobs.
                ```
                cache:
                key: docker-login
                paths:
                    - ~/.docker/config.json
                ```
    - Automatically triggered by: 
        - Pushes to main, feature/*, or merge requests.
        - Scheduled nightly CI jobs.
    - By default, these jobs are run in parallel

3. Image Deployment
    - After downloading:
        ```
        docker load -i image.tar
        ```
    - Final deployment pushes image to GitLab Container Registry or Docker Hub.

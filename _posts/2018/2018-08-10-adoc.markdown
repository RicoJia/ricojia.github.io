## ðŸ“„ What is AsciiDoc?

An `.adoc` file is a text file written in AsciiDoc formatâ€”a lightweight and readable markup language used for writing technical documentation, software manuals, README files, and even books. AsciiDoc is similar in spirit to Markdown, but more powerful and extensible. Itâ€™s often used when more complex formatting is needed without sacrificing readability in plain text.

### ðŸ§© Features of .adoc Files

- Reusable Content: With macros and includes.
- Extensible: Supports plugins and custom processors.
- Document Attributes: Easily define metadata like authorship, version, and dates.

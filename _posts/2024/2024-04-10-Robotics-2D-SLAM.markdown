## Introduction

The assumption of a robot moving on a 2D plane is a strong one. However, many indoor robots do have support an assumption. Maps in this case can simply be interpreted as an image. Low-end 2D Lidars use a belt to turn its head. Hotel robots and cleaning robots usually use solid-state Lidars.

When the robots do need to perceive heights outside of its 2D Lidar's range, we usually either add an RGBD camera, or manually label on the map for restrcited areas.

- Labelling is more difficult in the 3D world. One example is labelling **heights of traffic lights**. In most cases, labelling is done on 2D.

In circa.2007, 2D SLAM was a hit. Sebastian Thrun and Gmapping authors: Wolfram Burgard, Cyrill Stachniss, and G Grisetti are some big names there. EKF SLAM family and the Particle SLAM Family (Fast-SLAM, RBPF SLAM) were popular. Their problem is that once the map is crooked, we can't easily fix them. 

Early days: no front end or back end; only one map is saved; Simple Loop closure detection;
Modern 2D SLAM: Pose Graph is used as backend; Key frames or sub-maps are the basic process units; Guarantees complete map after loop closure

Concepts:
- Scan is a complete 360 deg LiDAR scan
- Scan matching is to find the relative pose between a scan vs another scan / map. **Scan matching is the core technique in a 2D SLAM**
- Submap: the map generated by several scans
- Occupancy gid: probability representation of a 2D map

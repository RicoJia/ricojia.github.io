## Common Commands

- millis() is unsigned long

```cpp
unsigned long previous_time = millis()
```

- `uint8_t lowByte(uint16_t value);`

```cpp
uint16_t value = 0x1234;

uint8_t lower = lowByte(value);
```

- `serial_port.println()` vs `serial_port.write()`
    - `serial_port.println()` adds carriage `\r`, and `\n`
        - it knows the size of the string because a C-string actually ends with a special null terminator (\0). We must add the null ourselves

- what's the difference between unsigned char and signed char?  Any difference in serial comm?
    - signed char: -128 to 127, signed char 0 - 255
    - So from a serial communication's perspective, there's no practical difference. However, to interpret data, yes, and unsigned char makes more sense for ASCII data

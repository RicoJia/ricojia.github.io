## Article: BLAS ("Basic Linear Algebra Subalgorithms")

BLAS is a set of **specifications** of linear algebra operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, etc. It's categorized into 3 levels: 

- level1: vector operations such as dot products. Usually `O(n)`
- level2: vector and matrix operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. `O(n^2)`
- level3: matrix operations. Usually O(n^3) operations

It can be found on almost all computing platforms, from desktops, GPU, to super computers. 

`LAPACK`  (`Linear Algebra Package`) is a library that provides solvers for linear systems, linear least squares, eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomp. Famous examples are: matrix factorizations like LU, LLT, QR, SVD, Schur. It's built on top of BLAS in Fortran. Many users however just stick to the LAPACK API and chooses different implementations.

`BLAS` and `LAPACK` has two most popular implementations:
- `OpenBLAS` 
- Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). It's highly optimized, and  It's packaged in python.

They use advance optimization techniques such as:

- Loop unrolling
- SIMD instructions
- cache blocking

## Introduction

The C++ memory model was formally introduced in **C++11**  mainly for multithreading. Before C++11:

- Threading was platform-dependent. (POSIX threads for Unit systems)
- Behavior of shared memory and data races **was undefined and left up to the OS/hardware/compiler.**
    - ü´†Ô∏è "Pthreads lib assume no data race." Pthreads are a **thin wrapper over OS-level primitives** and don‚Äôt prevent data races. It's the programmer‚Äôs job to synchronize correctly.

C++11 added:

- A standard memory model.
    - Compared to `Pthreads`, the C++11 memory model enforces stricter semantics, which helps correctness but might introduce overhead compared to bare-metal threading APIs like Pthreads.
    - ‚ùóÔ∏è "Memory ordering: Thou shalt not modify the behavior of a single-threaded program". The compiler is **free to reorder instructions for optimization as long as the observable behavior of a single-threaded program doesn‚Äôt change** ‚Äî this is called the as-if rule. But in multithreaded programs, these reorderings can cause data races unless explicitly synchronized, which is why C++11 introduced a well-defined memory model.
- `std::thread, std::mutex, std::atomic` types

This brought C++ more in line with Java/C# in terms of native threading support.

## Example: Memory Reordering by the Compiler

C++ compilers can reorder instructions as part of optimization ‚Äî as long as the observable behavior in a single-threaded program is preserved (per the as-if rule). This can lead to subtle issues in multi-threaded programs.

- cpp code
    ```cpp
    int A, B;
    void foo()
    {
        A = B + 1;
        B = 0;
    }
    ```

- without optimization: 
    ```assembly
    $ gcc -S -masm=intel foo.c
    $ cat foo.s
    ...
    mov     eax, DWORD PTR _B  (redo this at home...)
    add     eax, 1
    mov     DWORD PTR _A, eax
    mov     DWORD PTR _B, 0
    ...
    ```

- With Optimization: 
    ```cpp
    $ gcc -O2 -S -masm=intel foo.c
    $ cat foo.s
    ...
    mov     eax, DWORD PTR B
    mov     DWORD PTR B, 0
    add     eax, 1
    mov     DWORD PTR A, eax
    ...
    ```

**Why this matters**: One can see that it's possible that B (which may be atomic) can be ready before A (which may/may not be atomic). In a multithreaded context, this reordering can cause issues. For example, another thread might observe B == 0 while A has not yet been updated. This can violate intended synchronization logic.

**How to prevent:** Use `std::atomic` with proper memory ordering (e.g., `memory_order_seq_cst`) to prevent unwanted reordering.

Atomics act as compiler and CPU fences, ensuring ordering constraints are respected where required.

## Introduction

GDB is **EXTREMELY** handy. I used to doing a lot of print statements, but now I use GDB a lot. The reason is simple: I can check multiple things at once without recompiling everytime, especially my compilation time is long.

## Concepts

Debug Symbols in C or C++ are mappings from machine code to function names, variable names, line numbers, etc.

E.g., in a binary, `i` is just a memory location. When built with a `Debug` flag (see the Usage section), we know the variable's name.

```cpp
int i = 1;
```

Debugging symbols do not impact the binary execution logic. It's purely informational and consumed by gdb. The binary filesize though would increase.

### Compilation 

- In `CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)
```
    - Or alternatively, `catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`

- In `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -g -o myprog myprogram.c
```

### Run GDB

- In a ROS Launch file:

```xml
<node pkg="rgbd_slam_rico" type="rgbd_rico_slam_mini" name="rgbd_rico_slam_mini" output="screen" launch-prefix="gdb -ex run --args"/>
```

- Alternatively, you can run the binary using the command `gdb`:

```bash
gdb ./devel/lib/<PACKAGE_NAME>/binary
```

## GDB Usage

Some common usages include:

- `b <FILE_NAME>:<LINE_NUM>` set a breakpoint
- `r`: run 
- `c`: continue
- `p <var_name>`: print a variable name
- `info breakpoints`: check which breakpoints are available
- `delete <BREAKPOINT_NUM>`: to delete a break point's number

Some cautions:

- When debug printing an element in a `cv::Mat`, we need to specify its data type. To print it as a: 
    - double (`CV_64F`), do `(gdb) x/4g var`. 4 means the first 4 values, `g` means double precision. 
    - float (`CV_32F`): `(gdb) x/4f var`
    - int: `(gdb) x/4d var`

## With ROS2

```
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
gdb --args ./test_direct_3d_ndt_lo --gtest_catch_exceptions=0

# 5 In gdb:
(gdb) catch throw   # break on any C++ throw
(gdb) run
# gdb will now break inside std::_Deque_base<...>::_M_range_check
# you can then:
(gdb) bt           # to see the backtrace
(gdb) info locals  # to inspect variables
```


## Core Dump

Assume we have multiple C++ nodes that crash after running a long time (so they are hard to reproduce). What would be a good way to start debugging?

- Core dump

 A "core dump" is a snapshot of a computer program's memory state, typically taken when the program crashes or terminates abnormally, and it's used to help diagnose the cause of the crash.

- How to get it working:
    1. `ulimit -c unlimited`
    2. Adjust kernel settings to store it in /tmp:
        ```
        cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
        ```
    3. To change it: `sudo sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=/tmp/core.%e.%p.%h.%t`
    4. `/etc/systemd/system.conf`
        ```cpp
        DefaultLimitCORE=infinity
        ```
    5. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
    6. Create a crash program:
        ```cpp
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main() {
            // Intentionally dereference a NULL pointer to cause a segmentation fault.
            int *ptr = NULL;
            *ptr = 42;
            return 0;
        }
        ```
    7. Compile the executable with **debugging symbols**:
        ```cpp
        gcc -o0 crash_example crash_example.c
        ```
    8. Temporarily Enable Core Dumps: `ulimit -c unlimited`
    9. Verify that the current core dump file name pattern with: `cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`
    10. Run the program: `./crash_example`
    11. Launch gdb: `gdb ./crash_example /tmp/core.<executable_name>.<pid>.<hostname>.<timestamp>`: and run `bt` at gdb. There will be backtrace saved

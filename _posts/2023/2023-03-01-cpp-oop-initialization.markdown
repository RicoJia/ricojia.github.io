## Default Initialization

Default Initialization is **when a variable is initialized without explicit value**. They could be in an uninitialized state and accessing them could be an undefined behavior.

- POD types like `int`, `float` are initialized to an **intermediate value**. Accessing them without initialization is an undefined behavior,
    - Default initialization guarantees to initialize POD data, **but not array data**
- User defined types should either **have no constructor provided, or have a default constructor present.**

```cpp
class A{
    A(){};  // This is NOT default initialization
    A() = default;  // This IS default initialization
};

class B{
    int value;  // There's a synthesized default initializer as well.
};
```

- `static` storage duration always default initializes to 0, whereas automatic storage variables are default initialized to intermediate values

```
int x;          // automatic storage, intermediate value
static int y;   // default initialized to 0
int *j;         // automatic storage, intermediate value
static int *p   // static storage, default initialized to nullptr

int arr[5];        // Elements have indeterminate values
static int arr[5]; // All elements default-initialized to 0
```

Best Practices:

- Use **brace initialization** `{}` (C++ 11) to explicitly initialize variables

```cpp
int i{};    // explicitly initialized to 0;
```

### Designated Initialization

```cpp
struct A{
    int j;
    int k;
};
// A a{.k = 1, .j = 2}; // this won't work
A a{.j = 1, .k = 2};
```
- Your struct must have public fields.
- Safer: avoids bugs from wrong field order.


## Memory Order of Class Members

Declaration Order: Variables appear in memory in the order they are declared in the struct/class.

```cpp
struct Example {
    int a;     // Offset 0
    double b;  // Offset 8 (if 8-byte alignment is required for double)
    char c;    // Offset 16 (next available slot for alignment)
};
```

### Default Parameters

- Default values are given in `.hpp` files, not `.cpp`. In `.hpp` file, do `void VoxelGrid(CloudPtr cloud, float voxel_size = 0.05);`. You wouldn't need it in the `.cpp` files

## Ctor for Inheritance

- Python would allow a child class without a ctor if parent has a ctor with args. C++ wouldn't. **we need to define a ctor for the child class too**
    ```python
    class Parent:
        def __init__(self, x):
            self.x = x

    class Child(Parent):
        pass  # No constructor

    c = Child(42)  # ‚úÖ Works fine in Python
    ```

    ```cpp
    class Parent {
    public:
        Parent(int x) {}  // no default constructor
    };

    class Child : public Parent {
        // No constructor ‚Üí ‚ùå compile error
    };

    Child c(42);  // üí• Error: no matching constructor for 'Child'
    ```

## [Advanced] Parsing and Construction

The compiler parses class definition, then constructs class instances during runtime.

### 1 - Parsing (During Compilation)

Parse the class body linearly from top to bottom

1. Class member **declarations**
    - Member types, and names are registered
    - Member default initializers `(int x = 42;)`, but this is not usable **until the full class is fully parsed**
2. Nested structs/classes
3. Function declarations
    - This includes ctor. For this example:
        ```cpp
        class Foo{
            public:
                struct Options{
                    int max_iterations = 100;
                }
                Foo(Option o = Options()){}
        };
        ```



### 2 - Runtime Construction

1. In the order of declaration (top to bottom): Base class ctor, then derived classes are run.  
    - The order of class variable initialization is determined by **the declaration order**, not the order in initializers. [Reference](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/OOP53-CPP.+Write+constructor+member+initializers+in+the+canonical+order)
        ```cpp
        class MyClass{
            /*
                * Below public functions are defined in the order of operation
            */
            public:
                // Step 0: Create this object when first powered on
                MyClass(): previous_time_(millis()), current_status_(Status::UNINITIALIZED)
                {}

                Status current_status_;
                unsigned long previous_time_;
        };
        ```
    - `current_status_` is declared first, so it's constructed first, though  `previous_time_` appears first in the initializer list
    - **[Extra Note]**: We need to make sure the vairable order is consisntent in both the initializer list and the variable definition. One common warning we see is `warning: <VAR> will be initialized after [-Wreorder]`

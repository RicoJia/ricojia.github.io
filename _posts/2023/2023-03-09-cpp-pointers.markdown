## Raw Pointers 

### üöÄ Basics

1. new and delete:

    - If you use new, you must use delete ‚Äî otherwise, memory leak! [see code](https://github.com/RicoJia/notes/blob/master/examples/c%2B%2B_examples/dynamic.cpp). 
    - `new[]`:**size must be provided as part of the signature**. 
        ```cpp
        new int[10]();           // value-initialized to 0
        new int[5]{1, 2, 3};     // OK: extra elements zero-initialized
        new int[]{1, 2, 3};      // ‚ùå error: size must be explicit
        ```
    - **new[] must match delete[]**. A simple `delete` will yield undefined behaviour.
          - delete will take not into account the number of objects, but `delete[]` will.   
          - delete[] should not be used on regular `char*`, unless it is ```char* c = new char[size_]; ```. 

2. Structs that contain pointers
    - Default-initialized pointers inside a struct are `nullptr` ‚Äî but that means no memory is allocated. ‚Üí You must `new` those inner pointers manually.

### üìå Using Pointers

1. Initialization:
    - Pointers are not auto-initialized.
    - Always explicitly initialize to nullptr in constructors or field declarations.

2. **Getting array size is unsafe**: `sizeof(int*) / sizeof(int);  // ‚ùå not safe`

3. When to use raw pointers:
    - Small, performance-critical code with clear ownership semantics.
    - If your function doesn't care about ownership, prefer:

        ```cpp
        void f(widget& w);     // ‚úÖ clear, safe
        void f(widget* w);     // ‚úÖ OK if nullable
        void f(shared_ptr<widget>& w); // ‚ùå misleading ‚Äî might reset or alias others
        ```

4. After `delete` or `free`, set the pointer to `nullptr`:
    - Avoids use-after-free or double-free errors.
        ```cpp
        delete ptr_;
        ptr_ = nullptr;
        ```
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Cautions: Always initialize your pointers! Uninitialized pointers cause random crashes or data corruption.


5. Drawbacks of `int* i`: 
    - Is it a pointer to a single int or an array?
    - Does it own the memory? 
        -  If yes:
            - Who deletes it?
            - Use delete or delete[]?
            - Is it dangling?
            - Did you miss deleting one copy?

    - Raw pointers have no metadata ‚Äî they don‚Äôt convey **ownership or lifetime info**. That's why modern C++ prefers smart pointers.

6. const and Pointers
    - `int* const ptr` ‚Üí `constant pointer to int`
    - `const int* ptr` ‚Üí `pointer to constant int`
    - `const shared_ptr<T>` ‚âà `T* const` ‚Üí shared_ptr can't be reassigned, but pointee can be mutated
    - `shared_ptr<const T>` ‚Üí pointer to const object
        - If you're using `shared_ptr<const T>`, you must initialize in initializer list, especially for class members.

### üìö Arrays

- `arr[1] = 10;` will compile even if arr doesn‚Äôt own the memory. ‚Üí Might segfault at runtime depending on what arr points to.
- Multidimensional arrays:
    - For `arr[1][2]` to work, arr must be `int**`, not `int*`.
    - Or use `std::vector<std::vector<int>>` for safety.
    - No clean way to convert pointer back to array form:
        - Raw pointers have no size metadata.
        - You lose bounds-checking and iteration safety.

## Casting

`static_pointer_cast` vs `dynamic_pointer_cast`: 

- ```RTTI``` is run time type information, if a base class **has at least a virtual function**, then base class ptr can be **dynamic_cast** to derived class 
    - **(downcast, upcast is derived -> base)**
    - ```dynamic_cast``` is only for downcasting. dynamic_cast can happen in runtime. 
    - **If downcasting fails (not derived class), nullptr is returned.** 
    - You can downcast references as well ‚Üí throws `std::bad_cast`
    - Safer, but slower than `static_cast`
    
- ```static_cast``` happens **during compile time, no RTTI is needed**. 
    - **If you're sure you can downcast to a specific type**, use static_cast since it's cheaper, and the language allows you to do so

- ```static_pointer_cast``` vs ```static_cast```: ```static_pointer_cast``` works on shared_ptrs, because you can't cast its type directly. 
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class B {
        //virtual void fun() {} // NEED TO ADD THIS!!
    };
    class D : public B {
    };

    int main()
    {
        B* b = new D;
        D* d = dynamic_cast<D*>(b);

        // 1. use dynamic_cast if we're not sure if we can succeed
        if (d != NULL)
            cout << "works";
        else
            cout << "cannot cast B* to D*";

        // 2. cpp still allows you to use static_ptr_cast
        std::static_pointer_cast<DerivedClass>(ptr_to_base)->f();
        // 3. even static_pointer_cast
        static_cast<DerivedClass*>(ptr_to_base.get())->f();      // equivalent to above

        return 0;
    }
    ```

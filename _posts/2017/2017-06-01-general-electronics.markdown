## Electronics Testing

### ICT (In-Circuit Testing)

ICT is a type of testing performed directly on PCB to check each component for open / short circuits, incorrect part placement. Method:

- Build a "bed-of-nails" fixture that includes test points, probes
- The fixture measures resitance, voltage, capacitance

So it's quick, good test coverage, automated. but it can't test the high level features. 

### Functional Testing

Test the system's overall performance, such as communication, user interfaces, power distribution.

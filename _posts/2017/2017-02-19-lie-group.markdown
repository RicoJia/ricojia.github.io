## Group Definition

Group (Group) is an algebraic structure consisting of **a set** and **an operation**. Denote the set as `A`, and the operation as `⋅`. Then, the group can be written as `G=(A,⋅)`. 

- Closure (封闭性): `∀a1,a2∈A, a1​⋅a2​∈A`.
- Associativity （结合律）: `∀a1,a2,a3∈A, (a1⋅a2)⋅a3=a1⋅(a2⋅a3)`
- Identity （幺元）: There exists a0​∈A such that `a⋅a0​=a0​⋅a=a`
- Inverse （逆）: `∀a∈A,∃a_i∈A such that a⋅a_i=a_i⋅a=a0`

If you speak mandarin, this rule is shortened to "封结幺逆", which rhymes with "凤姐咬你" 💩

Some commonly seen groups include:

- The integers under addition (Z,+Z,+), 
- Rational numbers under multiplication (excluding 0)
- General Linear Group `GL(n)`: The group of `n×n` invertible matrices under matrix multiplication.
- Special Orthogonal Group `SO(n)`: The group of rotation matrices, where `SO(2)` and `SO(3)` are the most common.
- Special Euclidean Group `SE(n)`: The group of transformations in n-dimensional space, such as `SE(2)` and `SE(3)`.

Abstract groups can be discrete (like integers) or continuous (like real numbers). `SO(n)` and `SE(n)` are continuous. 

## Lie Group, Lie Algebra and Manifold Definition

This is an intuitive introduction of Lie Group and Lie algebras, [inspired by this post](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/148116/lie-algebra-in-simple-terms).

The Lie group is named after **Sophus Lie**. A group is a Lie group if it is a group, and is smooth (so integers are not a Lie group). Common Lie groups include:

- `SO(n)`, `SE(n)`
- `GL(n)`
- `SU(n)`: Special unitary group of nxn complex matrices that preserve complex inner products.

Every Lie group has a Lie algebra. A Lie Algebra is a **vector space that captures the infinitesimal structure of a Lie Group, e.g., the tangent space of the Lie Group**. The general definition of Lie algebras is: a Lie algebra consists of a set `V`, a field `F`, and a binary operation `,`. We also define `[]` as the **Lie bracket**:

- Closure: `∀X,Y∈V, [X,Y]∈V.`
- Bilinearity: `∀X,Y,Z∈V, ∀a,b∈F`, $[aX+bY,Z]=a[X,Z]+b[Y,Z],[Z,aX+bY]=a[Z,X]+b[Z,Y].$
- Antisymmetry (or Skew-symmetry): `∀X∈V, [X,X]=0`.
- Jacobi Identity: `∀X,Y,Z∈V` $[X,[Y,Z]]+[Y,[Z,X]]+[Z,[X,Y]]=0$

In the context of `SO(3)`, the lie algebra `so(3)` describes the algebra of infinitesimal rotations. Specifically, it's a skew matrix (see below), with **Lie Bracket** defined as $[X,Y]=XY−YX$

A manifold is a shape that's locally euclidean and globally connected. Integers are not a Lie Group because they are discrete. But real numbers form a consecutive Lie Group.  **A Lie group has to be a smooth manifold, meaning it's differentiable.**
    - Elements in a Lie group can transition to each other through multiplication, inverse, and identity.

- All 3D rotation matrices form a group called "Special Orthogonal Group, SO(3)", whose definition is $RR^T = I, det(R) = I$
- **Their corresponding skew symmetric matrices are their Lie Algebra so(3)**. The exponential $exp(\phi^{\land}) = R$ is called "exponential mapping"
  - **Within any Lie algebra, there is Lie Bracket for vectors A and B**: `[A, B] = AB - BA`

## SO(3)

SO(3) is the most common representation of rotation I've seen so far.

$$
\begin{gather*}
\exp(\hat{\omega}) = I + \frac{sin(\theta)}{\theta} \hat{\omega} +  \frac{1 - cos(\theta)}{\theta} \hat{\omega}^2
\end{gather*}
$$

Common rotation matrices are:

$$
\begin{gather*}
R_x(\gamma) = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \cos \gamma & -\sin \gamma \\
0 & \sin \gamma & \cos \gamma
\end{bmatrix}

R_y(\beta) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \beta & 0 & \sin \beta \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-\sin \beta & 0 & \cos \beta
\end{bmatrix}

R_z(\alpha) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \alpha & -\sin \alpha & 0 \\
\sin \alpha & \cos \alpha & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather*}
$$

## Skew Symmetric Matrices

Let $\phi \in R^3$ be a vector, and let $R \in SO(3)$ be a rotation matrix (i.e., $R^TR = I$ and $det⁡(R)=1$). Define the “hat” (or wedge) operator $\phi^{\land}$ as the skew-symmetric matrix satisfying

$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
& \phi^{\land} x = \phi \times x
\end{aligned}
\end{gather*}
$$

for any $x \in R^3$

### From Skew Symmetric `so(3)` To SO(3)

We can see that R'R^T must be a skew matrix:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
& RR^T = I
\\ & \Rightarrow (RR^T)' = R'R^T + RR'^T = 0
\\ & \Rightarrow R'R^T = -(RR'^T) = -(R'R^T)^T = \phi(t)^{\land}
\end{aligned}
\end{gather*}
$$

Where $\phi(t)^{\land}$ the skew matrix of vector $\phi(t) = [\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_1,]$

$$
\begin{gather*}
\phi(t)^{\land} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -\phi_3 & \phi_2 \\
\phi_3 & 0 & -\phi_1 \\
-\phi_2 & \phi_1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather*}
$$

Then, **one can see that taking the direvative of `R` is equivalent to multiplying the skew matrix $\phi(t)^{\land}$ with it.**
$$
\begin{gather*}
R'R^TR = R' = \phi(t)^{\land} R
\end{gather*}
$$

The above is also known as the Poisson Formula. If we define

$$
\begin{gather*}
w^{\land} = R^{T}R'
\end{gather*}
$$

We have another form of the **Poisson Formula**:

$$
\begin{gather*}
R' = Rw^{\land}
\end{gather*}
$$

Finally, do matrix exponential:

$$
\begin{gather*}
R(t) = exp(\phi(t)^{\land})
\end{gather*}
$$

### Rodrigues Formula

Let's represent the skew matrix as angle multiplied by a unit vector, $a^{\land}$

$$
\begin{gather*}
-\phi(t) = [\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3] = \phi a^{\land}
\end{gather*}
$$

By writing out $a^{\land} a^{\land}$ "Unit" skew matrices have the below two properties:

$$
\begin{gather*}
a^{\land} a^{\land} = aa^T - I
\\
a^{\land} a^{\land} a^{\land} = -a^{\land}
\end{gather*}
$$

- One trick for the second formula is: $a^{\land} (a^{\land} a^{\land}) = a \times (aa^T - I) = -a^{\land}$

So,
$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
& exp(\phi^{\land}) = exp(\theta a^{\land}) = \frac{1}{n!}(\theta a^{\land})^n
\\
& = I + \theta a^{\land} + \frac{1}{2!} \theta^2 a^{\land} a^{\land} + \frac{1}{3!} \theta^3 a^{\land} a^{\land} a^{\land} + ...
\\
& = aa^T - a^{\land} a^{\land} + \theta a^{\land} + \frac{1}{2!} \theta^2 a^{\land} a^{\land} - \frac{1}{3!} \theta^3 a^{\land}...
\\
& = aa^T + (\theta - \frac{1}{3!} \theta^3 + ...)a^{\land} - (1 - \frac{1}{2!} \theta^2 + ... )a^{\land} a^{\land}
\\
& = aa^T + sin(\theta) a^{\land} -cos(\theta) a^{\land} a^{\land}
\\
& = cos(\theta) + (I-cos(\theta)) aa^T + sin(\theta)a^{\land}
\\
Or
\\
& = I + (1-cos \theta) a^{\land} a^{\land} + sin \theta a^{\land}
\end{aligned}
\end{gather*}
$$

## Properties

- $ \phi^{\land} R = R (R^T \phi)^{\land}$

Proof:

First, we know from $ (a \times b) \cdot c = a \times (b \cdot c)$

$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
& (\phi^{\land} R)x = \phi^{\land}(Rx)
\end{aligned}
\end{gather*}
$$

One key property about rotation is commutation: **a rotated cross product is the same as the rotated vectors' dot product**.

$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
& R(a \times b) = (Ra) \times (Rb)
\end{aligned}
\end{gather*}
$$

So on the right, 

$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
& R (R^T \phi)^{\land} x= R((R^T \phi) \times x)
\\ &
= \phi \times (Rx) = (\phi^{\land} R)x
\end{aligned}
\end{gather*}
$$

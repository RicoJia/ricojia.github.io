## Electromotive Force (EMF，电动势)

In short, EMF is:

```
changing magnetic field -> induced voltage
```

It's characterized by the Faraday's law:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
& \epsilon = -N \frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta t}
\end{aligned}
\end{gather*}
$$

- $\epsilon$ is the electromotive force (EMF), or commonly, "induced voltage"
- $Delta \phi$ is the change in magnetic flux.
- $N$ is the number of coils

Basically, Faraday's law is to say "the induced voltage is the negative of the total rate of change of flux linkage"

EMF's unit is `volts` but it's also `joules/column`

## Eddy Current

Eddy current is called "eddy" because it looks an [eddy or whilrpool in fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_(fluid_dynamics)). Under the hood, it's Faraday's Law.

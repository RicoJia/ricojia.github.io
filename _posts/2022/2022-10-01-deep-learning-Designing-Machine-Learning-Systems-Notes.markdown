Machine learning is to learn complex patterns from **existing data**, and use them to predict on unseen data. MLOps is a set of tools and best practices for bringing ML into production. ML Algorithms are only a small part of ML systems. The data stack, the logic for monitoring, data updating, and how users interact with the model are all important. In 2016, **Google integrated multilingual neural machine translation** into Google Translate, which is the first success story of deep learning in production at scale.
